# Ecological Coaching Course — Comprehensive Upgrade & Build Log

**Purpose**  
This document defines the *complete* upgrade path for the Ecological Coaching Course, integrating **all recommended expansions**: scaffolding, tiering, time-coding, developer guardrails, monetization logic, and implementation artifacts.

It is written to be handed directly to ZenCoder with **zero ambiguity**.  
No concepts should be invented. No terminology should be reinterpreted.

---

## TARGET PROFILE

- **Total Runtime:** 60–90 minutes (excluding optional resources)
- **Audience:** Youth & High School Volleyball Coaches
- **Primary Promise:**  
  Coaches leave knowing *exactly* what to do in their next practice—and why.

---

## CORE DESIGN RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Translation Always**
   - Every concept must include a gym-floor example.
2. **Implementation > Inspiration**
3. **Reduce Anxiety**
   - Explicitly normalize discomfort and messiness.
4. **Ecological Integrity**
   - No internal-focus cues.
   - No isolated technique constraints.
5. **NAC Is the Spine**
   - Not branding. Not optional.

---

## TIER 1 — Foundations & Translation (Paid Entry)
**Runtime:** 35–45 min  
**Goal:** Understanding + early application

Includes:
- Core ecological concepts

- Intro practice design

---

## TIER 2 — Implementation & Mastery (Paid Premium)

# TIME-CODED MODULE MAP (PRIMARY BUILD GUIDE)

---

## MODULE 1 — Orientation & Reframing
**Tier:** 0  
**Runtime:** ~8 min

Key Additions:
- Myths (chaos, no feedback, anti-technique)
- Why this feels uncomfortable
- Early progress illusions

Outcome:
Coach feels *safe to continue*.

---

## MODULE 2 — Ecological Foundations
**Tier:** 1  
**Runtime:** ~12 min

Required Concepts:
- Constraints (space, time, task, info)
- Affordances (invitations for action)
- Perception–action coupling

Each must include:
> “If you want X behavior, consider changing Y constraint.”

---

## MODULE 3 — Translation Layer (CRITICAL)
**Tier:** 1  
**Runtime:** ~15 min

Focus:
- What can change without stopping play
- What you are actually training
- What not to change

Deliverable:
Mental “Constraint Menu.”

---

## MODULE 4 — Practice Design Architecture
**Tier:** 2  
**Runtime:** ~15 min

Required Framework:
1. Arrival Game  
2. Main Game  
3. Transfer Game  
4. Reflection / Reset

Include:
- Why fewer games matter
- Natural repetition emergence
- Scaling difficulty

Anchor Games (3–5):
- Purpose
- Reveals
- Constraint sliders
- Failure modes
- Language to avoid

---

## MODULE 5 — Coaching Behavior as a Constraint
**Tier:** 2  
**Runtime:** ~10 min

Include:
- Tone regulation
- Silence as information
- Question design

Side-by-side language swaps required.

---

## MODULE 6 — NAC Integration (SIGNATURE)
**Tier:** 2  
**Runtime:** ~10 min

Explicit Mapping:
- Notice → relevant info
- Adapt → constraint shifts
- Commit → next-sequence intent

NAC must function as:
> A real-time coaching operating system.

---

## MODULE 7 — “I’m Stuck” Scenarios
**Tier:** 2  
**Runtime:** ~10 min

Scenarios:
- Flat energy
- Over-silliness
- Drill requests
- Parent/admin pushback
- Immediate-fix athletes

Each includes:
- What’s happening
- Why old fixes fail
- EcoD/NAC response
- Language examples

---

# SUPPORTING ARTIFACTS (MANDATORY)

These are implementation accelerators, not bonuses.

- Practice Planning Template (.pdf / .md)
- Constraint Menu Cheat Sheet
- Coach Language Swap Guide
- Sample Season Arc
- Coach Reflection Prompts

---

# MINIMUM VIABLE PAID VERSION (MVP)

If scope must be reduced initially:
- Tier 0 (full)
- Tier 1 (full)
- Tier 2: Modules 4 + 6 only

Remaining Tier 2 modules released later.

---

# POSITIONING STATEMENT

> “This course helps coaches move beyond drills—without losing structure, clarity, or control—by teaching them how to design environments that produce adaptable, intelligent players.”

---

# DEVELOPER GUARDRAILS (ZENCODER)

- Do not invent terminology.
- Do not reframe NAC.
- Do not add drills.
- Do not include internal-focus cues.
- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- Volleyball-specific examples only.
