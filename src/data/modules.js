No pressure. No decision-making.\n- In our games: You receive unpredictable balls. You make choices. You adapt.\n\nUnderpressure in a game with real stakes, your nervous system learns faster.\n\nDrill reps are volume. Game reps are depth."\n\n**The Proof:**\n\n"Watch what happens when we play for 30 minutes. By the end, you\'ll see more clean passes than in 2 hours of partner passing drills—and you\'ll own them."\n\n**The Offer:**\n\n"If after 4 weeks you\'re not seeing improvement, we\'ll adjust. But trust the process."\n'
