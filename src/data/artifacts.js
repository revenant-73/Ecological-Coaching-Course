## PRACTICE SESSION: [DATE]

**Duration:** [Total Minutes]  
**Team Level:** [Youth/High School]  
**Focus Area:** [What skill/decision are we training?]

---

## PRE-PRACTICE NOTES

**What did I notice last practice?**  
[Observation 1]  
[Observation 2]  
[Observation 3]  

**What constraint might address this?**  
[Constraint idea]  

**What is the real skill I'm developing?** (not the symptom)  
[Skill description]

---

## PHASE 1: ARRIVAL GAME (5–10 min)

**Game Name:** [e.g., Wash, Rally Scoring, etc.]

**Setup:**  
[Court configuration]  

**Rules:**  
[Basic scoring/structure]  

**Your role:**  
- Observe. Don't teach.
- Note individual and team state.
- Collect baseline data.

**What are you watching for?**  
[What reveals player readiness?]

---

## PHASE 2: MAIN GAME (15–25 min)

**Game Name:** [Same as Arrival or variant]

**Constraint(s) Applied:**  
1. [Constraint 1 & its purpose]
2. [Constraint 2 & its purpose]

**Why these constraints?**  
[How does each make the desired behavior unavoidable?]

**Setup & Rules:**  
[Detailed game structure]  

**What you're NOT saying:**  
[Language to avoid during this phase]  

**How to know it's working:**  
[What behavior change signals success?]

**Failure modes to watch for:**  
[How might players cheat or avoid the challenge?]

---

## PHASE 3: TRANSFER GAME (10–15 min)

**Game Name:**  

**Constraint Change(s):**  
- Remove: [Which constraint goes away?]
- Modify: [Which constraints stay but change?]

**Why this adjustment?**  
[This tests if learning transfers to higher complexity]  

**Your role:**  
- Silent observation
- Safety only (no technical feedback)

**Transfer indicators:**  
[How will you know they're applying what they learned?]

---

## PHASE 4: REFLECTION (3–5 min)

**Question 1:**  
> "What did you notice changed when we [removed/modified that constraint]?"

**Question 2:**  
> "Why do you think that helped?"

**Question 3:**  
> "How does that apply in a real match?"

**Your role:**  
- Listen. Don't explain.
- Let players articulate their discovery.
- Write down their insights.

---

## POST-PRACTICE REFLECTION

[Describe what you observed, not what you expected]  

**Did the constraints work?**  
[What changed? What didn't?]  

**Did players discover what you hoped?**  
[Yes/No/Partially - explain]  

**What will you do next practice?**  
[What will you NOTICE, ADAPT, COMMIT to?]  

**Notes for future:**  
[Anything to remember for next time?]  

---

## CONSTRAINT MENU REFERENCE

For future sessions, record constraint adjustments that worked:

| Problem Observed | Constraint Changed | Result |
|-----|-----|-----|
| [e.g., Setter panicking] | [e.g., Reduce rally pace] | [e.g., Improved decision-making] |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## COMMON PROBLEMS & CONSTRAINT SOLUTIONS

### PASSING ISSUES

**Problem: Passes are erratic (too high, off-target)**
- Constraint: "Setter must call 'ready' before first contact reaches them"
- Effect: Forces passer awareness, setter communication

**Problem: Passers moving backward (creating distance)**
- Constraint: "Passer must move forward to pass, or it doesn't count"
- Effect: Forces aggressive positioning

**Problem: Weak digging on attack**
- Constraint: "Digger who handles the ball stays on court (winners stay)"
- Effect: Rewards tough defense, motivates effort

---

### SETTING ISSUES

**Problem: Setters making poor decisions under pressure**
- Constraint: "First contact → set = max 2 touches"
- Effect: Forces faster decision-making in safer context

**Problem: Setters not moving with the ball**
- Constraint: "Setter must touch the ball with feet in same spot where it was passed"
- Effect: Creates footwork dependence naturally

**Problem: Setters not reading blocks**
- Constraint: "If blocker is set when pass arrives, setter must adjust set height"
- Effect: Demands real-time reading

---

### HITTING ISSUES

**Problem: Hitter keeps getting blocked (same angle)**
- Constraint: "Blocker only sees setter, not hitter"
- Effect: Blocker can't cheat; hitter must read spacing

**Problem: Hitter swinging into obvious blocks**
- Constraint: "Any hit into a block = -2 points"
- Effect: Sudden-death consequences for bad shots

**Problem: No shot selection (always attacking)**
- Constraint: "Court is divided into zones; kills only count in assigned zone"
- Effect: Forces decision-making about where to attack

---

### BLOCKING ISSUES

**Problem: Blockers not committing (slow hands)**
- Constraint: "Blocker gets +2 points for any touch (block or hand contact)"
- Effect: Rewards proactive positioning

**Problem: Blockers not reading setter**
- Constraint: "Hitter announces option AFTER setter touches ball"
- Effect: Forces blocker to read actual movement

**Problem: Blocking footwork is sloppy**
- Constraint: "Blocker must be in set position before first contact"
- Effect: Makes premature footwork impossible

---

### TEAM COORDINATION

**Problem: Players not talking/communicating**
- Constraint: "No call = ball goes to other team (treat it as an error)"
- Effect: Forces communication or cost is immediate

**Problem: Multiple people going for same ball**
- Constraint: "If two players touch ball simultaneously, it's a side-out"
- Effect: Creates need for role clarity and calling

**Problem: Inconsistent team rotations/coverage**
- Constraint: "Specific player always covers back row; if they don't, -1 point"
- Effect: Makes positioning automatic

---

### ENERGY & ENGAGEMENT

**Problem: Flat energy, going through motions**
- Constraint: "Winning team stays on court; losing team sits out or runs"
- Effect: Creates natural intensity and consequence

**Problem: Players not focused/silly**
- Constraint: "Any unforced error = -1 point"
- Effect: Increases stakes, demands focus

**Problem: Low intensity even in "real" game**
- Constraint: "Rally scoring with sudden-death (next point wins after deuce)"
- Effect: Makes every point life-or-death important

---

### DEFENSIVE POSITIONING

**Problem: Defense plays too tight (not reading hitter)**
- Constraint: "Hitter doesn't attack until defense is set; then hitter can attack any zone"
- Effect: Rewards preparation, punishes lazy reading

**Problem: Defense too spread out (no coverage)**
- Constraint: "All digs must be made within 6 feet of net"
- Effect: Forces compact, coordinated defense

**Problem: Backcourt not moving up (waiting)**
- Constraint: "Backcourt players must be moving forward when first contact happens"
- Effect: Eliminates reactive positioning

---

## THE CONSTRAINT FORMULA

When you see a problem:

1. **Name the actual skill gap** (not the symptom)
   - NOT: "Your footwork is bad"
   - YES: "Decision-making under pressure"

2. **Find the constraint that makes better choices unavoidable**
   - Change rules, not technique
   - Change scoring, not feedback
   - Change structure, not mindset

3. **Apply it silently**
   - No explanation needed
   - Let the game teach
   - Players will figure it out

4. **Let it run for 10 minutes**
   - Don't switch constantly
   - Give constraint time to work
   - Observe patterns

5. **Ask after:**
   - "What did you notice changed?"
   - Listen. Don't add your analysis.
   - Let them own the learning

---

## CONSTRAINT SLIDER ADJUSTMENT

If your constraint isn't working:

**Too Hard?** → Make it easier
- "First contact to set = max 3 touches" (not 2)
- "Smaller court" → "Larger court"

**Too Easy?** → Make it harder
- "Blocker now gets +3 points instead of +2"
- "Narrower attacking zone"

**Not Addressing the Problem?** → Try a different constraint
- Don't make the same constraint harder
- Try a different lever (scoring vs. rule vs. positioning)

Traditional coaching language trains dependence on your feedback.  
Ecological language trains independence and decision-making.

Use this guide to catch yourself mid-sentence.

---

## SCENARIO 1: CORRECTING A MISTAKE

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Your footwork is bad. Step forward into the ball."**

*What happens:* Player becomes dependent on your diagnosis. They stop thinking. Next time you're not there, they're lost.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**[Say nothing. Modify the game.]**

Example constraint: "Passer must move forward to the ball, or it doesn't count."

OR (if you must speak):  
**"What did you notice about where your feet were?"**

*What happens:* Player becomes conscious of their own choice. They own the observation. Next time they adjust automatically.

---

---

## SCENARIO 2: ENCOURAGING EFFORT

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Great job! You're getting so much better!"**

*What happens:* Player becomes praise-dependent. They start playing for your approval, not for learning. Confidence becomes fragile.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**"What made that work?"**

OR (silent approval):  
**[Nod. Move on.]**

*What happens:* Player becomes conscious of their own strategy. They repeat it because it works, not because you said so. Confidence becomes intrinsic.

---

---

## SCENARIO 3: EXPLAINING FAILURE

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"You missed the dig because you weren't ready. Get lower and stay ready."**

*What happens:* You become the problem-solver. Player waits for your next instruction. They don't learn to read their own readiness.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**[Modify the game: "Any dig after the first touch must happen within 5 feet of where you started."]**

This forces:
- Earlier positioning
- Anticipation instead of reaction
- Reading the hitter sooner

*What happens:* Player discovers readiness on their own. The game teaches. You stay quiet.

---

---

## SCENARIO 4: REDIRECTING FOCUS

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Stop thinking so much. Just play!"**

OR

**"You're overthinking it. Trust your instincts."**

*What happens:* Confusing directive. Player doesn't know what you want. Anxiety increases.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**[Change the game to reduce decision-making complexity.]**

Example: "Only 2 contacts allowed per side."

This forces simpler decisions automatically.

*What happens:* Cognitive load decreases naturally. Instincts emerge because there's no time to think.

---

---

## SCENARIO 5: REINFORCING GOOD DECISIONS

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Good decision! You read the block perfectly!"**

*What happens:* Player starts playing to impress you. Performance becomes dependent on your presence. Confidence is external.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**"How did you know to hit that angle?"**

*What happens:* Player becomes conscious of their own decision-making process. Next time they use the same process intentionally.

---

---

## SCENARIO 6: MANAGING FRUSTRATION

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Don't get frustrated. Everyone makes mistakes. Stay positive!"**

*What happens:* You're invalidating real feedback. Player disconnects from useful emotion. They learn to hide problems.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**[Silence. Let the game continue.]**

Then later:  
**"What's one thing you'd change about that sequence?"**

*What happens:* Frustration becomes fuel. Player channels it into problem-solving instead of shutting down.

---

---

## SCENARIO 7: CALLING OUT LAZINESS

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Come on! That's lazy! Give me some effort!"**

*What happens:* Shame-based motivation. Works short-term, burns out long-term. Player becomes guarded.

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**[Modify the game to make effort unavoidable.]**

Example: "Winning team stays on court; losing team sits out."

*What happens:* Effort emerges from structure, not shame. Intrinsic motivation replaces external pressure.

---

---

## SCENARIO 8: PRAISING THE PROCESS (GOOD)

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**"You got that pass with your feet way ahead of your hands. That's smart preparation."**

*What happens:* You're naming the strategy, not the outcome. Player becomes conscious of their method. They repeat it intentionally.

BUT—don't overuse this. One observation per practice is enough.

---

---

## SCENARIO 9: ASKING INSTEAD OF TELLING

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
**"Your block is collapsing because your hands are too wide."**

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
**"Where are your hands when the ball hits them?"**

OR (better):  
**[Change court size or target zone, forcing tighter blocks naturally.]**

---

---

## SCENARIO 10: THE HARDEST ONE—SILENCE

### ❌ TRADITIONAL
You watch a bad pass. You feel the urge to correct it. You say:  
**"Watch your platform! Keep your arms together!"**

---

### ✅ ECOLOGICAL
You watch a bad pass. You feel the urge. You:  
**[Say nothing. Watch the next two rallies. Then maybe ask: "What did you notice about your passing?"]**

*What happens:* Player learns to self-correct. Their nervous system recalibrates. Next time, they're ready without your voice.

This is uncomfortable. Do it anyway.

---

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**If you're explaining technique, you're doing too much.**

**If you're asking questions or modifying constraints, you're coaching.**

---

## PRACTICE THIS WEEK

1. **Record yourself at one practice.**
2. **Listen for patterns:**
   - How often do you explain?
   - How often do you ask questions?
   - How often do you stay silent?

3. **For every explanation you hear, write a constraint-based alternative.**

4. **Next practice, use 3 of those alternatives instead.**

That's it. One week. Three language swaps. Notice what happens.

This is a progression framework. Adapt timing based on your team's actual development.

---

## WEEKS 1–3: FOUNDATION SETTING
### Goal: Anchor basic constraints & decision-making

**Main Anchor Game:** Wash (normal scoring)

**Weekly Constraint Focus:**
- **Week 1:** Communication (calling the ball)
  - Rule: "No call = side-out"
  - Effect: Establishes decision-making and role clarity
  
- **Week 2:** Positioning readiness
  - Rule: "Defense must be set before first contact"
  - Effect: Rewards preparation over reaction
  
- **Week 3:** Decision quality over speed
  - Rule: "Setter decides between three options before committing"
  - Effect: Builds intentionality

**What to look for:** Do players start talking? Do they anticipate instead of react?

**Artifact integration:** Introduce **Practice Planning Template**. Have coaches document weekly reflections.

---

## WEEKS 4–6: SKILL DIFFERENTIATION
### Goal: Develop position-specific decision-making

**Anchor Games:** Wash + King of the Court (rotation pressure)

**Position-Specific Constraints:**

**Passers:**
- Week 4: "Movement forward = better pass"
- Week 5: "Passer calls next action (set or attack)"
- Week 6: "Passer decides set target before contact"

**Setters:**
- Week 4: "Move with ball, feet placement matters"
- Week 5: "Read blocker before committing to hitter"
- Week 6: "Manage setter transition (defense → offense)"

**Hitters:**
- Week 4: "No shot selection = no scoring"
- Week 5: "Read block before committing to angle"
- Week 6: "Timing adjustment based on set quality"

**Blockers:**
- Week 4: "Hands ready before first contact"
- Week 5: "Read setter, not hitter"
- Week 6: "Footwork sync with partner blocker"

**What to look for:** Position-specific roles emerging naturally. Less chaos, more intentional spacing.

**Artifact integration:** Deploy **Constraint Menu Cheat Sheet**. Have players start noting which constraints help them most.

---

## WEEKS 7–9: SYSTEM INTEGRATION
### Goal: Connect position-specific skills into team flow

**Anchor Games:** Wash + King of the Court + 2v2 (isolation practice)

**System-Level Constraints:**

**Week 7: Serve Reception → Set → Attack Flow**
- Constraint: "Passer must look at setter position before passing"
- Constraint: "Setter must be ready within 2 steps of passer"
- Effect: Creates natural spacing and flow

**Week 8: Defense → Transition → Attack**
- Constraint: "Dig must land within 5 feet of net"
- Constraint: "Setter starts attacking transition from dig"
- Effect: Speeds up transition, removes hesitation

**Week 9: Block → Coverage → Transition**
- Constraint: "Blockers responsible for off-block tips"
- Constraint: "Coverage rotates with block"
- Effect: Coordinates defensive system

**What to look for:** Whole-team decision-making. Anticipation of teammates' needs. Less shouting, more flow.

**Artifact integration:** **Coach Language Swap Guide** focus. Coaches practice asking questions instead of correcting.

---

## WEEKS 10–12: PRESSURE & POLISH
### Goal: Maintain system under match intensity

**Anchor Games:** Full game simulation (best version of your team)

**Match-Prep Constraints:**

**Week 10: Variability & Adaptation**
- Constraint: "Each rally starts with a different serve type"
- Constraint: "Blockers change positions each rally"
- Effect: Reduces reliance on routine, builds adaptability

**Week 11: Decision-Making Under Pressure**
- Constraint: "Rally scoring + sudden death (next point wins)"
- Constraint: "Substitution/rotation changes mid-match"
- Effect: Tests system resilience and decision clarity

**Week 12: Final System Test**
- No new constraints
- Full game play (match rules)
- Observation only
- Reflection on the season

**What to look for:** Team cohesion. Automatic decision-making. Calm under pressure. Your voice mostly silent.

**Artifact integration:** **Coach Reflection Prompts** guide end-of-season assessment. Use this to plan Year 2.

---

## WEEKLY RHYTHM (SAMPLE)

Assuming 2–3 practice days per week:

### Practice Day 1 (45 min)
- Arrival Game (5 min)
- Main Game with 1–2 constraints (25 min)
- Transfer Game (10 min)
- Reflection (3 min)
- Debrief (2 min)

### Practice Day 2 (60 min)
- Arrival Game (5 min)
- Main Game with constraint variants (35 min)
  - First 15 min: Original constraint
  - Next 10 min: Modified version (harder)
  - Last 10 min: New constraint
- Transfer Game (15 min)
- Reflection (3 min)
- Debrief (2 min)

### Practice Day 3 (if applicable) (30 min)
- Arrival Game (5 min)
- Free play with observer feedback (20 min)
- Reflection on week (5 min)

---

## PROGRESSION LOGIC

**Constraint moves from:**
- Simple → Complex
- Individual → Team
- Controlled → Match-realistic
- Frequent adjustment → Rare adjustment (system becomes automatic)

**Each week:**
- Retain 60% of previous week's work (maintains base)
- Introduce 40% new element (progressive challenge)

**If team struggles:**
- Don't skip ahead. Repeat the week.
- Add a simpler constraint variant.
- Use smaller court or fewer players to reduce load.

**If team masters early:**
- Combine 2 constraints into one complex problem.
- Add time pressure (speed up rallies).
- Change team composition (shuffle players).

---

## DECISION POINTS FOR YOUR TEAM

### Red Flag: Low engagement mid-season?
**Not a motivation problem. The constraints aren't challenging enough.**
- Solution: Add complexity or consequences
- Example: Rally scoring, rotation pressure, zone restrictions

### Red Flag: Errors increasing in weeks 10–12?
**Not sloppiness. System is fragile under pressure.**
- Solution: Go back to Week 7–9 and rebuild with pressure layers
- Example: Repeat system integration with rotation changes

### Red Flag: Team not communicating by Week 6?
**Constraints aren't forcing enough interaction.**
- Solution: Tighten communication constraints
- Example: "Any ball touched without a call = side-out"

These are not tests. They're mirrors.

---

## WEEKLY REFLECTION (Use after each practice)

### OBSERVATION (What actually happened?)

1. **What was the first thing I noticed about my team today?**
   - (Not what you wanted to see. What you actually saw.)

2. **Which player surprised me? How?**

3. **When did my team look most engaged?**
   - (What was different about that moment?)

4. **When did I feel most anxious?**
   - (What triggered that? What did I want to control?)

---

### INTERVENTION (What did I do?)

5. **How many times did I speak before asking a question?**
   - (Just count. Don't judge. Awareness first.)

6. **Did I change a constraint today? What was the result?**
   - (Did behavior change? Did learning happen?)

7. **What did I *want* to say but didn't?**
   - (Why did I hold back? What would have happened if I'd said it?)

---

### REFLECTION (What does this reveal?)

8. **If I compare this week to last week, what changed?**
   - (In team capability? In my comfort? In communication?)

9. **What constraint am I most proud of this week? Why?**

10. **What constraint didn't work? What will I do differently?**

---

### PLANNING (What's next?)

11. **For next practice, what will I NOTICE first?**
    - (Decide this now, before practice. Bring intention.)

12. **What one change will I ADAPT?**

13. **How long will I let it run (COMMIT)?**

---

---

## MONTHLY REFLECTION (Mid-season check)

### TEAM DEVELOPMENT

14. **Which position has shown the most growth?**
    - Why that position?
    - What constraints drove it?

15. **Which position is still struggling?**
    - Is it a skill gap or a confidence gap?
    - What constraint might help?

16. **Is decision-making improving?**
    - Are they talking more?
    - Are they anticipating better?
    - Are they reading opponents more?

17. **Is technical skill improving?**
    - (Not isolated technique. Real-game technique under pressure.)

---

### YOUR COACHING

18. **How has your coaching changed this month?**
    - Are you talking less?
    - Are you asking more questions?
    - Is silence easier?

19. **When do you still feel the urge to jump in?**
    - What triggers that?
    - What would happen if you waited 10 more seconds?

20. **What's one coaching belief you've shifted?**
    - (What did you think was true a month ago that you're not sure about now?)

---

### PACE & PROCESS

21. **Is the progression pace right?**
    - Are constraints landing too hard? Too soft?
    - Is the team ready to move forward?

22. **What's working that surprised you?**

23. **What's not working that you thought would?**

---

---

## MID-SEASON ASSESSMENT (Weeks 6–7)

### FOUNDATION CHECK

24. **Go back to Week 1. Is the foundation solid?**
    - Are players still talking/calling?
    - Are they still positioning intentionally?
    - Or are they reverting to old habits?

25. **If foundation is soft, should we pause new work and rebuild?**
    - (This is not failure. This is wisdom.)

---

### SYSTEM INTEGRITY

26. **Is the team starting to flow as a system?**
    - Or is each position still isolated?
    - What's the gap?

27. **Who are the players driving team decision-making?**
    - Are they the same every day?
    - (If yes, decision-making may not be distributed.)

---

### READINESS FOR PRESSURE

28. **How will we know they're ready for match intensity?**
    - (Define success before you need it.)

29. **What will likely break under pressure?**
    - (Anticipate it. Prepare for it.)

---

---

## LATE-SEASON REFLECTION (Weeks 10–12)

### SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

30. **Under pressure, what's automatic?**
    - (That's your system working.)

31. **Under pressure, what breaks?**
    - (That's your fragile point. Next year's focus.)

32. **How different is match play from practice?**
    - (If very different, your practice constraints weren't realistic enough.)

---

### TEAM GROWTH

33. **What's the biggest shift from Week 1 to now?**

34. **Which player improved the most?**
    - What constraint drove that growth?
    - (Remember this for next season.)

35. **Who are you most excited to coach next season?**
    - Why?
    - What do they need to keep growing?

---

### YOUR GROWTH

36. **What coaching skill improved most?**
    - (Be specific. "Better communication" is too vague.)
    - What evidence shows you've improved?

37. **What's still hardest for you?**
    - Silence?
    - Restraint?
    - Trusting the process?

38. **What would you do differently if starting this season over?**

---

---

## END-OF-SEASON REFLECTION (After final match)

### SEASON ASSESSMENT

39. **What were the 3 biggest moments of growth?**

40. **If you had to describe this team in three words, what are they?**

41. **What's the skill you're most proud they developed?**

42. **What's the skill you wish you'd focused on more?**

---

### CONSTRAINT EFFECTIVENESS

    - Will you retry them next year or retire them?

45. **What new constraint are you excited to try next season?**

---

### SYSTEMS & STRUCTURE

46. **How well did your anchor games work?**
    - Did you stick with them or drift?
    - Were they the right games?

47. **Did your practice architecture (Arrival → Main → Transfer → Reflection) hold?**
    - Did players respond well to it?
    - What would you modify?

48. **How much did you rely on the Constraint Menu?**
    - Did you improvise more as season went on?
    - (Both are valid.)

---

### YOUR EVOLUTION

49. **How different is your coaching voice now vs. beginning of season?**

50. **What belief about coaching changed the most?**

51. **If a new coach asked you for advice right now, what's the one thing you'd tell them?**

52. **What will you practice as a coach over the off-season?**
    - (Silence? Asking better questions? Constraint design?)

---

### LOOKING FORWARD
